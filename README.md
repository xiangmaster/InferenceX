## Introduction

InferenceX™ (formerly InferenceMAX) is an inference performance research platform dedicated to continually analyzing & benchmarking the world’s most popular open-source inference frameworks used by major token factories and models to track real performance in real time. As these software stacks improve, InferenceX™ captures that progress in near real-time, providing a live indicator of inference performance progress. A [open sourced](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX-app) live dashboard  is available for free publicly at https://inferencex.com/. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only [SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX) repo contains the Official InferenceX™ result, all other forks & repos are Unofficial. The benchmark setup & quality of machines/clouds in unofficial repos may be differ leading to subpar benchmarking. Unofficial must be explicitly labelled as Unofficial.

## Why?

InferenceX™, an open-source, under Apache2 license, automated benchmark designed to move at the same rapid speed as the software ecosystem itself, is built to address this challenge.

LLM Inference performance is driven by two pillars, hardware and software. While hardware innovation drives step jumps in performance every year through the release of new GPUs/XPUs and new systems, software evolves every single day, delivering continuous performance gains on top of these step jumps. Speed is the Moat 🚀
 
AI software like SGLang, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, CUDA, ROCm and achieve this continuous improvement in performance through kernel-level optimizations, distributed inference strategies, and scheduling innovations that increase the pareto frontier of performance in incremental releases that can be just days apart.
 
This pace of software advancement creates a challenge: benchmarks conducted at a fixed point in time quickly go stale and do not represent the performance that can be achieved with the latest software packages.
